## Overview

**The Elder Scrolls Online Fish Master 3000** automates the fishing process in the game "The Elder Scrolls Online" by
detecting the presence of a sound file (a fish biting the hook) in real-time audio data and simulating a keyboard key
press when the sound file is detected.

## How does it work?

1. Find a fishing hole in the game.
2. Run `app.py`.
3. Turn on the switch.
4. Go back to the game and start fishing as you normally would.
5. Do something productive while Fish Master 3000 catches fish for you.
6. Fishing hole depleted? Turn off the switch and move to the next one.
7. Repeat.
8. Profit!

## Concept

**The Elder Scrolls Online Fish Master 3000** uses the following concept to automate the fishing process in the game "
The Elder Scrolls Online":

1. Thanks to [Votan's Fisherman](https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info918-VotansFisherman.html) plugin, the game plays a
   sound effect when a fish bites the hook.
2. The sound effect is recorded by the computer's audio input device.
3. The recorded audio data is analyzed in real-time to detect the sound effect.
4. When the sound effect is detected, a keyboard key is simulated to reel in the fish.
5. The process is repeated until all fish are caught and the fishing hole is depleted.
