# About

## Why did I create this app?

I created this app to learn more about Python, audio processing, and to automate a repetitive task in a game I enjoy
playing. I also experimented with Flask and its potential for developing quick desktop apps.

Also, I love creating and typing documentation, so here we are.

## Isn't this a very convoluted way to automate fishing?

Yes, it is.

It's ridiculous; there was no need to add an interface or add a wiggling fish, but it's fun and it works.

I love to see the fish icon wiggle while fishing, and the passive-aggressive messages that appear are fun to read. I'm sure there are better ways to do this — such as using The
Elder Scrolls Online API — but it was a fun experience putting this together.
