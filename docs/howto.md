## Fishing tips for the Elder Scrolls Online

The Fish Master 3000 will help you fish, but there are a few things you can do to speed up the actual fish-catching in
the game:

### Food buff

- Buy or craft [Artaeum Pickled Fish Bowl](https://eso-hub.com/en/food-drinks/delicacies/artaeum-pickled-fish-bowl) to
  gain the **Lure Allure** buff, which increases the speed at which you will get _Master Angler_ achievement by around
  32% by attracting rare fish faster.

### Champion Points

- Invest in and slot the [**Reel Technique**](https://eso-hub.com/en/champion-points/star/reel-technique) and the [**Angler's Instincts**](https://eso-hub.com/en/champion-points/star/anglers-instincts) passive skills in the 
  **Crafting** section of the **Champion Points**.
    - Reel Technique: *Decreases the time it takes for a fish to bite by 25%.*
    - Angler's Instincts: *Increases your chance of catching higher quality fish, akin to fishing with another
      player. **This effect can stack with other similar bonuses.*** — This means that this buff stacks with the
      Lure Allure buff from the Artaeum Pickled Fish Bowl.

### Gear and skills

Use a build that increases movement speed to get to fishing holes faster. Here are a few ways to increase your movement
speed:

- The Medium Armor passive Athletics provides a speed increase of 3% per piece, up to 21% with 7 pieces.
- The Swift Warrior Orc passive provides a unique 10% speed increase while sprinting.
- The [Coward’s Gear](https://eso-sets.com/set/cowards-gear) set provides a 30% speed increase while sprinting (Major
  Expedition).
- The [Fiord’s Legacy](https://eso-sets.com/set/fiords-legacy) set offers a unique 15% speed increase while sprinting.
- The [Jailbreaker set](https://eso-sets.com/set/jailbreaker) provides a speed increase of 15% (Minor Expedition).
- The [Retreating Maneuver skill](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/alliance-war/assault/retreating-maneuver) offers a 30%
  speed boost for a duration of 7 seconds (Major Expedition). The Ring of the Wild Hunt set grants a movement speed buff
  of 15% in combat and 45% out of combat.
- The [Steed Mundus Stone](https://eso-hub.com/en/mundus-stones/the-steed), with 7 Divine traits, results in a 16% speed
  increase.

  contributes to a 20% speed enhancement.

  purple quality, 5% at blue quality.

  combat and 45% out of combat.
- Any class or race is passive, and skills that increase movement speed.
- Summon a companion geared for damage and/or tanking to help you kill enemies that might attack you while fishing. If
  your class allows, summon pets like the
  sorcerer's [Volatile Familiar](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/sorcerer/daedric-summoning/summon-volatile-familiar)
  and [Twilight Tormentor](https://eso-hub.com/en/skills/sorcerer/daedric-summoning/summon-twilight-tormentor) to keep
  enemies away while you fish.
